This how-to video gets you up to speed with a quick introduction to recon-ng, a great framework for collecting OSINT automatically, and then goes straight into an example so you can see how the information gathering process works in practice.

In it, you'll learn:

 * how to run recon-ng and use the built-in help system
 * the basics of using workspaces to organize your OSINT engagements and keep records
 * methodology for starting your investigation by manually adding data and API keys to build from
 * techniques for conducting real-world reconnaissance using recon-ng's built-in capabilities, including how to choose which recon-ng modules to run
 * analysis methods to query recon-ng's database and view the intelligence you've collected
