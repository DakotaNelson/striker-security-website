I've been busy lately writing a comprehensive 4-part series on steganography and error correcting codes on the Black Hills Information Security blog.

The step-by-step guide takes you from the fundamentals of steganography all the way through a full image steganography example. Not only that, but it also includes a steganography tool in Python for you to use - and explains it!

<!-- more -->

You can find the guide in four parts on the Black Hills Information Security blog, starting with <a href="http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?p=5338" target="_blank">part 1</a>.

<p style="background-color:rgba(188,110,110,.6); padding: 8px;">
Interested in a faster way to get through all 4 parts and learn steganography techniques more quickly? Download a <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/19009757/submissions/new" data-drip-show-form="19009757">single PDF</a> of all the articles.

However, hiding data in images wasn't enough. The guide also introduces error correcting codes, which can help reduce errors caused when the picture your message is hidden in goes through compression. You not only get a hamming code tutorial, you also see actual hamming code examples to help you learn.

Understanding how to hide data in an image using steganography, and prevent that data from being corrupted, can prove very helpful for both attack and defense, including forensics. Check out part 1 of this series to learn image steganography algorithms and techniques, or download free, open-source steganography software in Python from <a href="https://github.com/DakotaNelson/hamming-stego" target="_blank">Github</a>.
