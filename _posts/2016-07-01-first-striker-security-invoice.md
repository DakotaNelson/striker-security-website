Today is an exciting landmark for Striker - our first invoice just went out!

Striker Security focuses on developing tools to support information security professionals by helping them grapple with the most difficult component of their work - acquisition, analysis, and application of mountains of data.


Our current work developing a system to geolocate attackers covers this entire spectrum - geolocation techniques, data collection, storage, and analysis, all the way through visualization, reporting and effective communication. The system is being developed for a small pentesting firm - stay tuned for its public release.


I'm incredibly excited to see where the road ahead takes us. If you would like to be part of the journey, <a href="{{ "/contact/" | prepend: site.url }}" target="_blank">get in touch</a> or sign up for our mailing list below.
