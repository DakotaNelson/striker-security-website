Thanks for making it to SOURCE Boston! The slides for my talk are available below, and you'll find my research notes further on down the page. I'll update this page with video once it becomes available.

The research notes you see here are a work-in-progress listing of NSA tools and programs along with a brief description of each. As of now, it has around 120 entries, but I hope to keep adding to that (doing this research is surprisingly fun).
