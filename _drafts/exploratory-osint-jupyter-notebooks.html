One of the most difficult parts of OSINT gathering (for me) is visualization and reporting of the data - and, worse, the process. Recording terminal output into terrible messy text files is far too raw to be of much use, and taking constant screenshots can be a pain - not to mention that the resulting images still require plenty of captioning, usually after the fact.


Thankfully, I get a lot of help from a development platform used heavily among the data science community known as Jupyter (formerly iPython Notebooks).
