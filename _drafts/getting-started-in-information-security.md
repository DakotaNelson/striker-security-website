Infosec is a way of life.

I'm probably getting nods from half information security (infosec) industry after saying that, and a disgusted look from the other half. For better or for worse, and for undoubtedly an incredible variety of reasons, security is more than just a job for a huge number of people. What this means for the field is a whole different blog post, but it does mean one very specific thing:

Breaking into the industry is staggeringly difficult.

As someone put it to me:

> I have tried to learn the basics of it but it seems like an industry that you must love so that you would know about it ... and I am struggling with this task.

In other words, "how do I even get started?"

This is definitely not going to be exhaustive, but below are some resources that I and others have found useful for getting started. (have more things you think should be added? <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">let me know</a>)

### Philosophy
Nope, I'm not joking. Well, maybe a little - these articles give great overviews of the field that is information security and how to get started.

### News, Events, Etc.
Staying up-to-date is perhaps the most taxing part of the infosec lifestyle. Everything moves incredibly fast, and the firehose of information can be hard to keep up with - or turn off.

### General Overview
One of the most difficult parts about security is that there's just so much scattered knowledge to know. These lists should help get you up to speed - no need to memorize everything, a good overview and an ability to quickly look things up should do.

### Conferences
There are security conferences across the world where people come together to talk about and share the things they find fascinating. Most of them record and release their talks, so you can share in the learning even if you can't travel.

### Hands-On Practice
Actually putting your knowledge to use is the best way to learn, but hacking especially can be a bit difficult to get experience in without breaking a law or two. Here are some ideas on how to do it the right way.
