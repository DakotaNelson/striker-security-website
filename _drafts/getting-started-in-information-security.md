Infosec is a way of life.

I'm probably getting nods from half of the information security (infosec) industry after saying that, and a disgusted look from the other half. For better or for worse, and for undoubtedly an incredible variety of reasons, security is more than just a job for a huge number of people. What this means for the field is a whole different blog post, but it does certainly mean one thing:

**Breaking into the industry is staggeringly difficult.**

As someone put it to me:

> I have tried to learn the basics of it but it seems like an industry that you must love so that you would know about it ... and I am struggling with this task.  

In other words, "how do I even get started?"

This is definitely not going to be exhaustive, but below are some resources that I and others have found useful for getting started. (have more things you think should be added? <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">let me know</a>)


### Philosophy
Nope, I'm not joking. Well, maybe a little - these articles give great overviews of the field that is information security and how to get started.

* Derek Banks at Black Hills Infosec talks about the path to developing your "Hacking Kung Fu": [http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?p=4655](http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?p=4655)


### News, Events, Etc.
Staying up-to-date is perhaps the most taxing part of the infosec lifestyle. Everything moves incredibly fast, and the firehose of information can be hard to keep up with - or turn off.

* Bruce Schneier runs a great blog at [https://www.schneier.com/](https://www.schneier.com/) that provides a beginner-friendly introduction to current events.
* Lawrence Hoffman at Black Hills Infosec does an excellent weekly news roundup in his aptly named weekly blog post, Lawrence's List - [http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?s=Lawrence%27s+List](http://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/?s=Lawrence%27s+List)
* Another fantastic weekly news and events roundup comes from Scott Piper over at [https://summitroute.com/blog/](https://summitroute.com/blog/).
* Security Weekly is a major information security podcast run by Paul Asadoorian. A massive list of Paul's RSS feeds at [http://securityweekly.com/PaulsFeeds.opml](http://securityweekly.com/PaulsFeeds.opml) gives a peek behind the curtain at the impressive information-gathering machine powering it all.
* A variety of security experts converse on the DailyDave mailing list at [http://seclists.org/dailydave/](http://seclists.org/dailydave/), which has a notable focus on the larger strategy and politics behind security.


### General Overview
One of the most difficult parts about security is that there's just so much scattered knowledge to know. These lists should help get you up to speed - no need to memorize everything, a good overview and an ability to quickly look things up should do.

### In-Depth Introductions
Want a comprehensive compendium of knowledge on a a topic? These are great ways to get started on an aspect of security without hopping frantically across the Internet.

* In *Hacking the Xbox* , Andrew "bunnie" Huang provides an incredible book on hardware hacking detailing various ways to "enjoy a Microsoft Xbox game console without the mindless tedium of playing video games." A free copy has been released by the author at [http://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox_Free.pdf](http://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox_Free.pdf).
* Ever wondered how exploits actually work? [*Hacking: The Art of Exploitation*](https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) is a great place to start. I've heard of people avoiding this book due to the somewhat campy title - something something don't judge a book by its cover.
* Want to know how to do offensive security professionally? Penetration testing is real, and Georgia Weidman shows you how in [*Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking*](https://www.nostarch.com/pentesting). (I hear if you use code GEORGIA at checkout good things will happen)
* [http://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2015/09/30/advanced-threat-tactics-course-and-notes/]


### Conferences
There are security conferences across the world where people come together to talk about and share the things they find fascinating. Most of them record and release their talks, so you can share in the learning even if you can't travel.

### Hands-On Practice
Actually putting your knowledge to use is the best way to learn, but hacking especially can be a bit difficult to get experience in without breaking a law or two. Here are some ideas on how to do it the right way.
